# Pomidor Timer #

A simple timer for use in <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">The Pomodoro Technique®</a>, a time management system. 

One of the great things about <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">The Pomodoro Technique®</a> all the resources needed to use the system are free!  You can download the book and worksheets as PDFs and if you want to support them you can buy stuff from them. That's a great company. 

## Requirements ##

OS X 10.6

## Instructions ##

If you can't figure it out I can't help you... no one can.

## What does "Pomidor" mean? ##

Pomidor is Polish for tomato. It's a play on the Italian word for tomato, pomodoro, so I don't have to worry about trademark/copyright infringment.  

## Why is it free? ##

They provide the resources for free so I thought I'd provide this simple timer for free.   

There are applications that cost money and do more but I wanted to do one thing and do it well; be a timer.

## Can I sell it and make billions? ##
